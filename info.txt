Access on host machine:
	ssh -X -p 2222 jalombar@127.0.0.1



THEORY

Network flow:
	Browser -> NGINX (443 HTTPS) -> Wordpress (php-fpm on port 9000) -> MariaDB (database on port 3306).

Kernel = the core of the operating system, it manages the hardware and runs all programs.
Foreground = the process runs as the main job of the container (PID 1) so that if that process exits the container stops.
Docker Container = a process running on the host with its own isolated filesystem, network and PID space.


Docker:
	lets you run small, isolated systems called containers from images.
	
	Image = blueprint of the container (immutable).
	Container = running instance of the blueprint (mutable).
	Volume = persistent data outside container FS.
	Network = connects containers together so they can communicate by name, not by IP, and it keeps them isolated from the outside world.

	Rule = one service per container.

VM vs Container:
	A VM runs a full operating system with its own kernel.
	A Container shares the host's kernel, therefore it's lighter and faster.

HTTS/TLS:
	It encryps communication between the user and the server.
	The server create a certificate and then exchange it with the browser to crete a secure encrypted tunnel.

Bind mount vs Volume:
	A Bind mount maps a specific host folder (like /home/login/data).
	A Volume is managed by Docker.

Docker with or without Docker Compose:
	The containers are the same but Docker Compose just automates how they start and connect.
